If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\n *\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\n *\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\n * solution.\n *\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\n * default value for the type. Without the type tag but multiple value tags\n * it's possible to have default values for each tag in the oneof and not be\n * able to know which was actually in effect.\n */\nfunction hasTag(obj, type, tag) {\n    return type === tag || (!type && tag in obj);\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2017 Google Inc.\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n/**\n * Provides a simple helper class that implements the Stream interface to\n * bridge to other implementations that are streams but do not implement the\n * interface.
